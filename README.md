# House-Price-Prediction
This is a beginner Machine Learning project where I predict house prices based on "Square Feet, Bedrooms, and Bathrooms " using Linear Regression.

## Features
- Dataset: housing_price_dataset.csv
- Input Features: `SquareFeet`, `Bedrooms`, `Bathrooms`
- Target: `Price`
- Model: Linear Regression (scikit-learn)
- Tools: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn

## Results
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 12345
- RÂ² Score: 0.87

The model explains about **87% of the variance in prices** and predicts fairly close to actual values.
This project was really fun for me as a beginner to let machine predict by analyzing the training and testing data.

## How to Run
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
python house_price_prediction.py
